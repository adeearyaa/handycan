# Handycan

Project submission for Hack For Good 2023

A mobile application built using React Native that connects people with disabilities with information 
about accessible places in their community. The mobile app provides detailed reviews and feedback from users with disabilities, helping disabled individuals find places and facilities that meet their needs.

## Base Features 
#### User-Generated Reviews: 
Handycan will allow users to share their experiences at different locations, including information about the accessibility of the building, parking, restrooms, and other facilities.

#### Accessibility Ratings: 
The app will use a rating system to help users easily identify which places are the most accessible, based on feedback from the community.

#### Map View: 
The app will provide a map view that allows users to see the location of accessible places in their area, making it easier to find new places to visit.

#### Search and Filter: 
Users will be able to search for specific types of locations, such as restaurants, parks, or shopping centers, and filter results based on accessibility criteria, such as the presence of elevators or accessible parking.

#### Nearest Accesible Facility Search: 
Shows the nearest most accessible facility or place of choice (search bar + filter)

#### Color Mode: 
Different color modes with appropriate contrast for color deficient people

## Stretch Goals
#### Audio-to-Text Support: 
Allows for simple commands like "find me the most accessible nearest park" to be recognised and results will be displayed immediately

#### Real-Time Updates: 
Handycan will provide real-time updates on the accessibility of locations, including information about changes in accessibility, new construction, and other factors that may impact a user's ability to access a particular location.
